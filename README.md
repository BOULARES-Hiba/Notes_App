# 📝 SkripePad  
SkripePad is a **full-stack notes application** that allows users to register, log in, and manage their notes — including creating, editing, pinning, and deleting. It also features an **admin dashboard** for monitoring users and notes activity.  

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of the **core fundamentals of web development**:  

- **Authentication**  
- **APIs**  
- **Frontend–backend integration**  
- **Deployment**
